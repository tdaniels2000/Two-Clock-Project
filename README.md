Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
- This program is aimed to to meet international standard ISO 8601 by creating a 12- and a 24-hour clock. The standard provides a unambiguous and consistent way of representing dates and times to avoid confusion and misunderstanding.
What did you do particularly well?
- The code is well optimized for speed and efficiency to ensure that it runs smoothly and accurately while keeping it user-friendly and easy to navigate.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-  One potential vulnerability in this clock program could be the ability for users to input malicious code or data. To prevent this, the program should have input validation and sanitization strategies, which can help to ensure that all user data is legitimate and safe.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- ensuring that the program can handle different time zones and daylight saving time adjustments, this requires programming concepts related to time zones and daylight saving time.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-  the project involves time management skills, which are essential in any project management role. The ability to manage time effectively, set deadlines, and prioritize tasks is not only useful in programming but also in many other fields and industries.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I wrote clean and concise code that adhered to best practices and coding standards. I also made sure to include comments throughout the code to explain the purpose and functionality of each section, making it easier for future developers to understand and modify the code.
